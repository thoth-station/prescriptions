Prescriptions for Thoth's adviser

Prescriptions to heal your applications and application dependencies.

Why we created prescriptions?
=============================

We wanted to create a repository that keeps a database of known issues in
Python open-source eco-system, as well as suggestions for Python libraries
and runtime environments they can run in. The database is used in
`Thoth <https://thoth-station.ninja/>`__ to resolve high quality Python
software stacks. The `linked blog post describes prescriptions more in-depth
<https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/22/thoth-prescriptions-resolving-python-dependencies>`_.

  When using OpenShift or Kubernetes, one provides manifest files that state
  how the desired state of a cluster should look like. Prescriptions might
  be seen analogous to this - prescriptions provide a way to declaratively
  state how the desired dependency resolution should look like considering
  the prescribed rules. Then, it‚Äôs up to the reinforcement learning algorithm
  implemented in `Thoth's adviser <https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser>`__
  to find a solution in the form of a lockfile respecting the prescribed rules,
  requirements for the application and other inputs to the Thoth's cloud
  resolver.

See `the linked presentation

or `YouTube video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQO2yTQ_OD4>`__ for more info.

How to write a prescription?
============================

If you would like to write a prescription for resolver, check the `following
docs
<https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/prescription.html>`__.

Need help with a prescription?
==============================

If you spotted an issue in Python dependencies or Python ecosystem, just let us
know by openning an issue and we will help you with writing a prescription.

Data sources used for automatically generated prescriptions
===========================================================

Currently implemented `handlers
<https://github.com/thoth-station/prescriptions-refresh-job/tree/master/thoth/prescriptions_refresh/handlers>`_
in Thoth's weekly cronjob allow to auto-generate prescriptions for the given data:

- CVE present in a package, from the `PyPA advisory-database
<https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database>`_
- Project maintenance and development practices as evaluated by the `OSSF Security Scorecards
<https://github.com/ossf/scorecard>`_
- Information on package maintainance obtained via the GitHub API: if the given project is marked as archived, is forked from another project, hosts release notes, its number of maintainers, stars, contributors.
- The package size, number of downloads, maintainers and last release date from `PyPI
<https://pypi.org/>`_.

Release Details
==============================

Prescriptions are released as a blob.
During the tag release session of `thoth-adviser <https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser>`_,
the `s2i process <https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser/blob/master/.s2i/bin/assemble>`_ clones the prescriptions repo with the latest tag information.

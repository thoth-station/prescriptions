        message: "The lz4 packages provide support for LZ4, a very fast, lossless compression algorithm that provides compression speeds of 400 MB/s per core and scales with multicore CPUs. It also features an extremely fast decoder that reaches speeds of multiple GB/s per core and typically reaches RAM speed limits on multicore systems. Security Fix(es): * lz4: memory corruption due to an integer overflow bug caused by memmove argument (CVE-2021-3520) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section."

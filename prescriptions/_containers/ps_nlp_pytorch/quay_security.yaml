          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: Spoofing of XDG_SEAT allows for actions to be checked against \"allow_active\" instead of \"allow_any\" (CVE-2019-3842) * systemd: Mishandles numerical usernames beginning with decimal digits or 0x followed by hexadecimal digits (CVE-2020-13776) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          Kerberos is a network authentication system, which can improve the security of your network by eliminating the insecure practice of sending passwords over the network in unencrypted form. It allows clients and servers to authenticate to each other with the help of a trusted third party, the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC). Security Fix(es): * krb5: Sending a request containing PA-ENCRYPTED-CHALLENGE padata element without using FAST could result in NULL dereference in KDC which leads to DoS (CVE-2021-36222) * krb5: NULL pointer dereference in process_tgs_req() in kdc/do_tgs_req.c via a FAST inner body that lacks server field (CVE-2021-37750) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

          The systemd packages contain systemd, a system and service manager for Linux, compatible with the SysV and LSB init scripts. It provides aggressive parallelism capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, and keeps track of processes using Linux cgroups. In addition, it supports snapshotting and restoring of the system state, maintains mount and automount points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic. It can also work as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit. Security Fix(es): * systemd: uncontrolled allocation on the stack in function unit_name_path_escape leads to crash (CVE-2021-33910) For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.
